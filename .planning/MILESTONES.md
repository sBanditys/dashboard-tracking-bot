4. Real-time bot status via SSE with 5-second polling, last-seen timestamp, and graceful fallback
5. Full CRUD for accounts and brands with modals, confirmation flows, audit log, and guild settings
6. Analytics dashboard with counter cards, time-series charts, leaderboard, and activity timeline
7. Data management with exports (CSV/JSON/XLSX), bulk operations (delete/reassign), and trash with restore
8. Polish with error boundaries, offline detection, keyboard shortcuts, optimistic updates, and code splitting

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `feat(08-08)`
