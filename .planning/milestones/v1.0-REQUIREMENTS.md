## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Post management/editing | Dashboard is read-only for external content; links to original |
| Built-in chat/communication | Discord handles communication; dashboard is data/controls only |
| Bot infrastructure controls | Security risk; bot infra managed separately |
| Custom theme uploads | XSS risk; built-in light/dark mode sufficient |
| AI-powered summarization | High cost, unreliable; users want raw data |
| Social features (profiles, following) | Not a social network; data is private per guild |
| Mobile native app | Web responsive covers mobile use cases |
