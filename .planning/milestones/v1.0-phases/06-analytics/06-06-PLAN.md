  <what-built>
    Complete analytics system with:
    - Counter cards showing total accounts, posts, brands with trend indicators
    - Time-series area chart with posts per day/week, hover tooltips, click navigation
    - Leaderboard ranking tracked accounts by engagement
    - Activity timeline with day grouping and infinite scroll
    - Time range selector (7d/30d/90d) controlling all sections
    - Analytics sidebar link
    - Guild overview analytics preview (sparkline + top-5 leaderboard)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
    2. Navigate to a guild page (e.g., `/guilds/{guildId}`)
    3. **Guild overview check:**
       - Counter cards show trend indicators (up/down arrows with percentage)
       - Mini sparkline chart appears in analytics preview section
       - Top-5 leaderboard preview shows ranked accounts
       - "View full analytics" link navigates to analytics page
    4. **Sidebar check:**
       - "Analytics" link visible in sidebar when on any guild page
       - Click navigates to `/guilds/{guildId}/analytics`
       - Active state highlights when on analytics page
    5. **Analytics page layout:**
       - Counter cards span across top (4 cards on desktop, stacked on mobile)
       - Area chart and leaderboard sit side-by-side (chart 2/3 width, leaderboard 1/3)
       - Activity timeline below full width
    6. **Time range selector:**
       - Toggle between 7d, 30d, 90d
       - All sections update when range changes
       - Active range visually highlighted (purple)
    7. **Area chart:**
       - Purple gradient area chart renders
       - Hover shows tooltip with exact count and date
       - Click a data point — navigates to posts page filtered by that date
    8. **Leaderboard:**
       - Shows ranked accounts with view/like counts
       - Top 3 have colored rank indicators (gold, silver, bronze)
    9. **Activity timeline:**
       - Events grouped by day (Today, Yesterday, date headers)
       - Scroll down to trigger infinite scroll loading
       - Events are clickable, linking to related items
    10. **Empty states:**
        - If no analytics data, chart shows "No submissions data" message
        - If no leaderboard data, shows "No engagement data yet"
        - If no activity, shows "No recent activity"

    **NOTE:** If backend endpoints don't exist yet, the proxy routes will return errors. The verification should focus on:
    - UI layout renders correctly
    - Components handle error/empty states gracefully
    - Navigation and interactions work (time range toggle, click to navigate)
